Project: Connecticut’s Real Estate Market Analysis (2010-2022)

Overview: This project examines the impact of income, population growth, taxation, and geographic factors on housing prices and affordability in Connecticut from 2010 to 2022. The study utilizes data on real estate sales, household income, taxes, and population to analyze town-level trends and the elasticity of housing prices relative to income changes.

Goals:

Analyze economic factors affecting real estate trends and affordability. Provide insights into regional disparities and temporal changes in the housing market. Key Findings:

Regions with higher income and population growth have seen significant housing price increases. Taxation impacts affordability, particularly in wealthier areas. Housing prices are highly sensitive to income changes, especially in high-demand regions. Implications:

Recommendations for policymakers include boosting affordable housing supply and offering tax relief in high-demand areas. Investors should focus on areas with growing incomes and moderate taxes. Households should consider affordability and economic trends when purchasing homes. Data Sources:

Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, U.S. Census data, real estate and tax records from CT Gov and Data Gov.
